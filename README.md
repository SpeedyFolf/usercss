# UserCSS

My custom website styles for use with [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) (or any other UserCSS browser extension).

To install a style, simply click on the "Install directly with Stylus" button. It should work instantly with other extensions too, but in case it doesn't, you can copy the displayed code and paste it into an "Import" window or a new style in your preferred UserCSS manager.

You will receive style updates automatically, as long as your UserCSS manager supports them.
