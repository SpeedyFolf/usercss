# UserCSS

My custom website styles for use with [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) (or any other UserCSS browser extension).

To install a style, simply click on the "Install directly with Stylus" button. It should work instantly with other extensions too, but in case it doesn't, you can copy the displayed code and paste it into an "Import" window or a new style in your preferred UserCSS manager.

You will receive style updates automatically, as long as your UserCSS manager supports them.

Made in Mar 2024.

Makes the video player on the Twitch clips page exactly 1280x720 so the video is better quality. I found that by default the clip page video player is 1060x596 and with [FFZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com)'s "Allow the player to get larger on clips.twitch.tv pages" option on is 1426x802. I recommend having that FFZ option on so that the chat replay looks the correct height. If you want the same effect for the main streams page, I highly recommend [outfrost's script](https://github.com/outfrost/usercss?tab=readme-ov-file#twitch-player-resolution-fix).
